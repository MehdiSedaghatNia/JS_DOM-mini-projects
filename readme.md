# John Smilga JS course, DOM mini projects

This is from the **JavaScript course on Udemy** by **John Smilga**.

This repository contains my practice projects from John Smilga's JavaScript course. Each project focuses on different DOM manipulation techniques and JavaScript concepts, helping me strengthen my front-end development skills.
